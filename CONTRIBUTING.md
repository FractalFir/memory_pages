Since I don't anticipate a lot of usage of this crate or a lot of need for change, those guidelines are pretty bare-bones right now,
for whichI would like to apologise in advance.
# How to contribute
## Small fixes
1.  Open an issue with relevant label and clear description of what the issue is.
2.  You do your fix.
3.  You run `cargo test` and everting works.
4.  You run the commands in `Before merges`.
5.  Open pull request, I check it, and hopefully merged.
## Features
1. Open an issue with an enhancment label and clear description of what you want to contribute.
2. Some time passes and I respond
3. I either ask some more questions about the feature, tell you that it is incompatible with this crate/outisde it's scope or I accept your suggestion.
4. I give you the go-ahead and you work on your feature, while the issue stays open.
5. You finish your feature.
6. You run the commands in `Before merges`.
7. The merge either gets accepted if it works as intended, is delayed for further fixes or, in exterme cases is sadly rejected.
8. The mege goes smoothly and everyone is happy.
## Before merges
1. run `cargo clippy` to catch some more basic issues within your code. 
2. run `cargo fmt` to ensure consistent formatting.
## I don't bite, ask me anything
Peopele using my projects makes me very happy. Peopele wanting to contribute makes me even happer. So as long as you are a decent human being and follow the 
contribution rules, I am more than happy to help along with any features/fixes/suggestions.
